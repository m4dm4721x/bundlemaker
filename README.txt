BundleMaker

BundleMaker is a software dependency management tool based on Eclipse.

BundleMaker provides a set of parsers and analyzers that allows you to analyze all the dependencies beetween the resources of your application. Based in these information you can restructure your system by (virtually) grouping resources into arbitrary modules. Once the restructuring has been completed, you can export the newly modularized system into arbitrary target structures (e.g. OSGi bundles, PDE projects).
