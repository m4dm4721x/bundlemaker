BundleMaker is a software dependency management tool based on Eclipse.
======================================================================

BundleMaker provides a set of parsers and analyzers that allow you to analyze all the dependencies beetween the resources of your application. Based on these information you can (re-)modularize your application by (virtually) grouping resources into arbitrary modules. Once the restructuring has been completed, you can export the newly modularized system into several target structures (e.g. OSGi bundles, PDE projects).
